Web310 â€“ 2025 app av Mio og Sanjai

Our app is a website with the possibilities to improve your abilities within the IT universe. It will be from networks, security, development, basic system engineering and maybe some more. 
The backend will be purely Python Flask for server-side, as well as SQL to store all our data. The frontend will be in Vue, running from Node, which will be included in the Flask app. 
The main idea is for students as us, and of course new students, to have the ability to sort of combine learning with quiz, which seems to be something people like. It is supposed to have different levels with increasing difficulties in each category, with some sort of trophy system, which is yet to be decided how. We will also have a login which stores your progress in the different categories, and will contain personal information about the user, which will only be visible for the user and a potential admin. 
The potential admin should also have the possibilities to edit questions in the categories, as well as an overview of the users in the database. Every user should be able to see some sort of leaderboard.
